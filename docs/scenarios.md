a coming of age story in a solarpunk society:
- a young person (17 years old) who was trained in robotics and cyber systems engineering
- taking their "gap year" on a sustainability research mission at the outskirts of civilization
- stationed at a desert outpost (like Joshua Tree)
- near a desert ecovillage / supply depot / way station
- equipped with a mobile habitat sponsored by family and ecovillage community
- mobile habitat serves as home, workshop, lab, basecamp

        - wake up
        - habitat housekeeping
        - check current / available missions
        - do experiment / do online job (play minigame)
        - build / repair / augment
        - host/attend event with visitors/neighbors
        - take a trip (with others) into the wilderness
